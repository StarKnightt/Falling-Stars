## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports CSS animations.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarKnightt/Falling-Stars.git
```

## Usage

The stars fall with a rotation animation and disappear after a set duration. Customize the animation by adjusting parameters in the @keyframes rule and the stars function in script.js.


## Customization

Feel free to customize the appearance and behavior of the falling stars:

- Modify the @keyframes rule in style.css for different animation effects.
- Adjust the position, color, and text-shadow properties for the stars.
- Change the fontSize and animationDuration properties in the stars function for varied star sizes and falling speeds.

## Responsive Design

The project is designed to be responsive. Media queries have been implemented to adapt the styles for different screen sizes.

```
/* Media Queries for Responsiveness */

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .star {
        font-size: 8px; /* Adjust the font size for smaller screens */
    }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
    /* Add additional styles for screens between 601px and 1200px */
}

```
